serialization
=============

Boost.org serialization module

This repository adds a new serialization archive format based on HDF5 
to complement the ones already included in the official boost::serialization library: plain text, XML, and 
native binary. By building on the established and well-known boost::serialization framework, 
application code can use HDF5 or switch to any of the other established archive formats with 
only minimal changes to the code involved.

HDF5 has become a popular format to store scientific data. It is open and well-documented. 
Further advantages of HDF5 are the following:

* the format is self-describing and portable across computing platforms
* efficient storage of large arrays, parallel IO using MPI is possible (though not yet implemented)
* hierarchical description of stored data
* several low-level storage drivers, including single file or multiple-directory layouts

To compile and install this work in a Linux environment, please follow the following steps:

1. Retrieve the official Git boost superproject
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git modular-boost
```

2. Change the serialization module to refer to the HDF5 archive version. For a recent
version of Git you can edit the following line in ".gitmodules":

> "url = ../serialization.git" --> "url = https://github.com/warn-naught/serialization.git"

3. Synchronize submodules:
```bash
git submodule sync
```

4. Pull HDF5 serialization code from remote repository.
```bash
cd libs/serialization
git pull origin master
```

5. Bootstrap and update Boost headers (see https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/TryModBoost for details)
```bash
cd ../..
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 headers
```

6. Define paths to HDF5 headers and library (assuming a bash shell syntax)
```bash
export HDF5_INCLUDE_PATH=...
export HDF5_LIB_PATH=...
```

7. Compile serialization lib
```bash
cd libs/serialization/build
../../../b2 -q
```
